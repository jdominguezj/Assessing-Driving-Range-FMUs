# Assessing EVs Driving Range 

This repository contains the FMUs output from a Modelica library developed as part of a conducted research. Each FMU file obeys to 
a climate scenario condition. 
This project encompasses the development of a Modelica library for estimating the operational range of electric cars
taking into account environemntal variables such as wind speed and fluctuations in temperature. Simulations were developed using 
montecarlo methods (n=1000 Trials).

Both FMUs models can be used as Co-simulation and Model Exchange. We suggest the integration to the Python language through the 
PyFMI Library.
